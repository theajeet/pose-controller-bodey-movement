🎮 PSP Pose Controller – Control PSP Emulator Using Body Movements! 🚀 PSP Pose Controller is an innovative Python-based project that enables users to control a PSP emulator using body movements detected via a webcam! It leverages MediaPipe Pose, OpenCV, and PyAutoGUI to map different postures to PSP button presses.

🔥 Features ✅ Hand-Free PSP Control – Move your body to simulate D-Pad, buttons, and analog stick inputs. ✅ MediaPipe Pose Detection – Uses AI-powered pose estimation to track shoulders, wrists, and body posture. ✅ Custom Key Mapping – Simulates PSP controls (D-Pad, Cross, Circle, Square, Triangle, etc.). ✅ Real-Time Detection – Works with a standard webcam at 30 FPS. ✅ Lightweight & Easy to Use – Requires only Python and a webcam!

🎮 How It Works The program captures live video from your webcam. It uses Google MediaPipe Pose to track shoulders & wrists. Specific body positions & hand movements trigger PSP button presses via PyAutoGUI.
